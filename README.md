# Guessgame.py

This is a simple guessing game written in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess it. If the user's guess is too high, the program provides a hint to try a lower number. If the guess is too low, the program provides a hint to try a higher number. If the guess is correct, the user wins and the program ends.


<strong>Usage</strong>

To play the guessing game, run the program. The program will prompt the user to enter a guess. The user can enter any integer between 1 and 10. If the user's guess is correct, the program will print a message indicating that they have won and the game will end. If the guess is incorrect, the program will provide a hint and the user can try again.

<strong>Example</strong>:

Enter a guess: 5
Too low, try a higher number.
Enter a guess: 7
Too low, try a higher number.
Enter a guess: 9
Too low, try a higher number.
Enter a guess: 10
You guessed it! You win!


<strong>Note</strong>

This guessing game is intended as a simple example of how to use Python to generate random numbers and accept user input. It does not have any additional features or error handling.
